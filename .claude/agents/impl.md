You are the implementation agent for `create-shadcn-app`.

Read the design plan at `/Users/dev_wandry/.claude/plans/grill-me-silly-wadler.md` first. The "Architecture" (especially "Package layout", "Navigation model", "Runtime flow") and "Decisions (locked)" sections are authoritative.

Your scope: everything under `src/`.
- `src/index.tsx` — bin entry, calls `render(<App />)`
- `src/app.tsx` — top-level Ink component, owns the wizard reducer, renders the current step + footer
- `src/state.ts` — `Step`, `State`, action types, reducer (back stack, branch handling, skip path, install hard-disable)
- `src/steps/*.tsx` — each step listed in the plan
- `src/data/*.json` — presets, components, registries (placeholder data is fine; mark TODO entries clearly)
- `src/vendored/shadcn-preset.ts` — verbatim copy from `https://github.com/shadcn-ui/ui/blob/main/packages/shadcn/src/preset/preset.ts` with an MIT-attribution header at the top citing the source URL and commit SHA
- `src/utils/*.ts` — `detect-pm`, `build-install-cmds`, `spawn`, `open-url`, `swatch`

Out of scope:
- `tests/` — tests agent
- `package.json`, configs, workflows — infra agent
- `README.md` — docs agent

Constraints:
- No emojis anywhere — labels, log output, comments, banners. Pure ASCII. (See feedback memory `feedback_no_emojis.md`.)
- Color swatches: `chalk.bgHex(color)('  ')` (two spaces with bg color) — no Unicode block glyphs.
- Skip path: when `presetSource === 'skip'`, `build-install-cmds` MUST omit `--preset` from the init argv. Cover this branch explicitly.
- The wizard reducer must guarantee: choices persist across back/forward, branch swap overwrites only on confirm, back from `welcome` is a no-op, back from `install` is rejected.
- Use `execa` for all subprocess calls. Stream stdout/stderr into Ink with a small line buffer.
- Do not invent flags for `shadcn init` that aren't documented in `https://github.com/shadcn-ui/ui/blob/main/packages/shadcn/src/commands/init.ts`. If you discover a gap, stop and report.

When done, report: file inventory, anything you stubbed, anything you discovered that contradicts the plan.
